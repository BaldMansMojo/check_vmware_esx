History:
========

- 22 Mar 2012 M.Fuerstenau
  - Started with actual version 0.5.0
  - Impelemented check_esx3new2.diff from Simon (simeg / simmerl)
  - Reimplemented the changes of Markus Obstmayer for the actual version
  - Comments within the code inform you about the changes
  - It may happen that controllers has been found which are not active.
    Therefor around line 2300        the following was added:
 
    # M.Fuerstenau - additional to avoid using inactive controllers --------------
     elsif (uc($dev->status) eq "3")
           {
           $status = 0;
           }
    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------
          else
           {
           $state = 3;
          }
           $actual_state = Nagios::Plugin::Functions::max_state($actual_state, $status);
           }
           $perfdata = $perfdata . " adapters=" . $count . ";"$perf_thresholds . ";;";
 
          # M.Fuerstenau - changed the output a little bit 
          $output .= $count . " of " . @{$storage->storageDeviceInfo->hostBusAdapter} . " defined/possible adapters online, ";
 
- 30 Mar 2012 M.Fuerstenau
  - added --ignore_unknown. This maps 3 to 0. Why? You have for example several host adapters. Some are reported as
    unknown by the plugin because they are not used or have not the capability to reports something senseful.
 
- 02 Apr 2012 M.Fuerstenau
  - _info (Adapter/LUN/Path). Removed perfdata. To count such items and display as perfdata doesn't make sense
  - Changed PATH to MPATH and help from "path - list logical unit paths" to "mpath - list logical unit multipath info" because
    it is NOT an information about a path - it is an information about multipathing.
 
- 08 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed installation informations for the perl SDK from VMware. This informations are part of the SDK and have nothing to do
    with this plugin.
  - Replaced global variables with my variables. Instead of "define every variable on the fly as needed it is a good practice
    to define variables at the beginning and place a comment within it. It gives you better readability.
 
- 22 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Merged with the actual version from op5. Therfore all changes done to the op5 version:

  - 2012-10-02  Kostyantyn Hushchyn
    Changed to a conditional datastore refresh(Reduce overhead of solution suggested in issue #5787)
 
  - 2012-10-05  Kostyantyn Hushchyn
    Updated description so now almost all options are documented, though somewhere should be documented arguments like timeshift(-T),
    max samples(-M) and interval(-i) (Solve ticket #5950)
 
- 31 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced most die with a normal if statement and an exit.
 
- 1 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced unless with if. unless was only used eight times in the program. In all other statements we had an if statement
    with the appropriate negotiation for the statement.
 
- 5 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced all add_perfdata statements with simple concatenated variable $perfdata
 
- 6 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Corrected bug. Name of subroutine was sub check_percantage but thist was a typo.
 
- 7 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced $percc and $percw with $crit_is_percent and $warn_is_percent. This was just cosmetic for better readability.
  - Removed check_percentage(). It was replaced by two one liners directly in the code. Easier to read.
  - The only codeblocks using check_percentage() were the blocks checking warning and critical. But unfortunately the
    plausability check was not sufficient. Now it is tested that no other values than numbers and the % sign can be
    submitted. It is also checked that in case of percent the values are in a valid level between 0 and 100
 
- 12 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced literals like CRITICAL with numerical values. Easier to type and anyone developing plugins should be
    safe with the use
  - Replaced $state with $actual_state and $res with $state. More for cosmetical issues but the state is returned
    to Nagios.
  - check_against_threshold from Nagios::Plugin replaced with a little own subroutine check_against_threshold.
  - Nagios::Plugin::Functions::max_state replaced with own routine check_state
 
- 14 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced hash %STATUS_TEXT from Nagios::Plugin::Functions with own hash %status2.
 
- 15 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Own help (print_help()) and usage (print_usage()) function.
  - Nagios::plugin kicked finally out.
  - Mo more global variables.
 
- 25 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - $quickstats instead of $quickStats for better readability.
 
- 5 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed return_cluster_DRS_recommendations() because for daily use this was more of an exotical feature
  - Removed --quickstats for host_cpu_info and dc_cpu_info because quickstats is not a valid option here.
 
- 6 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced -o listitems with --listitems
 
- 8 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - --usedspace replaces -o used. $usedflag has been replaced by $usedflag.
  - --listvms replaces -o listvm. $outputlist has been replaced by $listvms.
  - --alertonly replaces -o brief. $briefflag has been replaced by $alertonly.
  - --blacklistregexp replaces -o blacklistregexp. $blackregexpflag has been replaced by $blacklistregexp.
  - --isregexp replaces -o regexp. $regexpflag has been replaced by $isregexp.
 
- 9 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Main selection is now transfered to a subrouting main_select because after
    a successfull if statement the rest can be skipped leaving the subroutine
    with return
 
- 19 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Reformatted and cleaned up a lot of code. Variable definitions are now at the beginning of each 
    subroutine instead of defining them "on the fly" as needed with "my". Especially using "my" for
    definition in a loop is not goog coding style
 
- 21 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - --listvms removed as extra switch. Ballooning or swapping VMs will always be listed.
  - Changed subselect list(vm) to listvm for better readability. listvm was accepted  before (equal to list)
    but not mentioned in the help. To have list or listvm for the same is a little bit exotic. Fixed this inconsistency.
 
- 22 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed timeshift, interval and maxsamples. If needed use original program from op5.
 
- 25 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed $defperfargs because no values will be handled over. Only performance check that needed another which 
    needed another sampling invel was cluster. This is now fix with 3000.
    
- 11 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine host_mem_info. Removed $value1 - $value5. Stepwise completion of $output makes
    this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
 
- 16 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Stripped down vm_cpu_info. Monitoring CPU usage in Mhz makes no sense under normal circumstances
    Mhz is no valid unit for performance data according to the plugin developer guide. I have never found
    a reason to monitor wait time or ready time in a normal alerting evironment. This data has some interest
    for performance analysis. But this can be done better with the vmware tools.
  - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine vm_mem_info. Removed $value1 - $value5. Stepwise completion of $output makes
    this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
 
- 24 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Because there is a lot of different performance counters for memory in vmware we ave changed something to be 
    more specific.
    - Enhenced explanations in help.
    - Changed swap to swapUSED in host_mem_info().
    - Changed usageMB to CONSUMED in host_mem_info(). Same for variables.
    - Removed overall in host_mem_info(). After reading the documentation carefully the addition of consumed.average + overhead.average
      seems a little bit senseless because consumed.average includes overhead.average.
    - Changed usageMB to CONSUMED in vm_mem_info(). Same for variables.
    - Removed swapIN and swapOUT in vm_mem_info(). Not so sensefull for Nagios alerting because it is hard to find 
      valid thresholds
    - Removed swap in vm_mem_info(). From the vmware documentation:
      "Current amount of guest physical memory swapped out to the virtual machine's swap file by the VMkernel. Swapped 
       memory stays on disk until the virtual machine needs it. This statistic refers to VMkernel swapping and not
       to guest OS swapping. swapped = swapin + swapout"
 
      This is more an issue of performance tuning rather than alerting. It is not swapping inside the virtual machine.
      it is not possible to do any alerting here because (especially with vmotion) you have no thresholds.
    - Removed OVERHEAD in vm_mem_info(). From the vmware documentation:
      "Amount of machine memory used by the VMkernel to run the virtual machine."
      So using this we have a useless information about a virtual machine because we have no valid context and we 
      have no valid thresholds. More important is overhead for the host system. And if we are running in problems here
      we have to look which machine must be moved to another host. 
    - As a result of this overall in vm_mem_info() makes no sense.
 
- 25 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed swap in vm_mem_info(). From vmware documentation:
    "Amount of guest physical memory that is currently reclaimed from the virtual machine through ballooning.
     This is the amount of guest physical memory that has been allocated and pinned by the balloon driver."
    So here we have again data which makes no sense used alone. You need the context for interpreting them
    and there are no thresholds for alerting.
 
- 29 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Renamed $esx to $esx_server. This is only for cosmetics and better reading of the code.
  - Reimplmented subselect ready in vm_cpu_info and implemented it new in host_cpu_info.
    From the vmware documentation:
    "Percentage of time that the virtual machine was ready, but could not get scheduled
     to run on the physical CPU. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of virtual
     machines on the host and their CPU loads."
    High or growing ready time can be a hint CPU bottlenecks (host and guest system)
  - Reimplmented subselect wait in vm_cpu_info and implemented it new in host_cpu_info.
    From the vmware documentation:
    "CPU time spent in wait state. The wait total includes time spent the CPU Idle, CPU Swap Wait,
     and CPU I/O Wait states. "
    High or growing wait time can be a hint I/O bottlenecks (host and guest system)
 
- 30 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Removed subroutines return_dc_performance_values, dc_cpu_info, dc_mem_info, dc_net_info and dc_disk_io_info.
    Monitored entity was view type HostSystem. This means, that the CPU of the data center server is monitored.
    The data center server (vcenter) is either a physical MS Windows server (which can be monitored better
    directly with SNMP and/or NSClient++) or the new Linux based appliance which is a virtual machine and
    can be monitored as any virtual machine. The OS (Linux) on that virtual machine can be monitored like
    any standard Linux.
 
- 5 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Revised the code of dc_list_vm_volumes_info()
 
- 9 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Revised the code of host_net_info(). The function was devided in two parts (like others):
    - subselects
    - else which included all.
    So most of the code existed twice. One for each subselect and nearly the same for all together.
    The else block was removed and in case no subselect was defined we defined all as $subselect.
    With the variable set to all we can decide wether to leave the function after a subselect section
    has been processed or stay and enhance $output and $perfdata. So the code is more clear and
    has nearly half the lines of code left.
  - Removed KBps as unit in performance data. This unit is not specified in the plugin developer 
    guide. Performance data is now just a number without a unit. Adding the unit has to be done 
    in the graphing tool (like pnp4nagios).
  - Removed the number of NICs as performance data. A little bit senseless to have those data here.
 
- 10 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Revised the code of vm_net_info(). Same changes as for host_net_info() exept the NIC section.
    This is not available for VMs.
 
- 14 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced $command and $subselect with $select and $subselect. Therfore also the options --command
    --subselect changed to --select and --subselect. This has been done to become it more clear.
    In fact these items where no commands (or subselects). It were selections from the amount of
    performance counters available in vmware.
 
- 15 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Kicked out all (I hope so) code for processing historic data from generic_performance_values().
    generic_performance_values() is called by return_host_performance_values(), return_host_vmware_performance_values()
    and return_cluster_performance_values() (return_cluster_performance_values() must be rewritten now).
    The code length of generic_performance_values() was reduced to one third by doing this.
 
- 6 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Substituted commandline option for select -l with -S. Therefore -S can't be used as option for the sessionfile
    Only --sessionfile is accepted nor the name of the sessionfile.
  - Corrected some bugs in check_against_threshold()
  - Ensured that in case of thresholds critical must be greater than warning.
 
- 11 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Changed select option for datastore from vmfs to volumes because we will have volumes on nfs AND vmfs. 
  - Changed output for datastore check to use the option --multiline. This will add a \n (unset -> default) for 
    every line of output. If set it will use HTML tag <br>.
 
- 13 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Replaced a previous change because it was wrong done:
    - --listvms replaced by subselect listvms
 
- 14 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Some minor corrections like a doubled chop() datastore_volumes_info()
  - Added volume type to datastore_volumes_info(). So you can see whether the volume is vmfs (local or SAN) or NFS.
  - variables like $subselect or $blacklist are global there is no need to handle them over to subroutines like
    ($result, $output) = vm_cpu_info($vmname, local_uc($subselect)) . For $subselect we have now one uppercase
    (around line 580) instead of having one with each call in the main selection.
  - Later on I renamed local_uc to local_lc because I recognized that in cases the subselect is a volume name
    upper cases won't work.
  - replaced last -o $addopts (only for the name of a sensor) with --sensorname
 
- 18 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine host_disk_io_info(). Removed $value1 - $value7. Stepwise completion of $output makes
    this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
  - Removed use of performance thresholds in performance data when used disk io without subselect because threshold
    can only be used for on item not for all. Therefore they weren't checked in that section. Senseless.
  - Changed the output. Opposite to vm_disk_io_info() most vlues in host_disk_io_info() are not transfer rates
    but latency in milliseconds. The output is now clearly understandable.
  - Added subselect read. Average number of kilobytes read from the disk each second. Rate at which data is read
    from each LUN on the host.read rate = # blocksRead per second x blockSize.
  - Added subselect write. Average number of kilobytes written to disk each second. Rate at which data is written
    to each LUN on the host.write rate = # blocksRead per second x blockSize
  - Added subselect usage. Aggregated disk I/O rate. For hosts, this metric includes the rates for all virtual
    machines running on the host.
 
- 21 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine vm_disk_io_info(). Removed $value1 - $valuen. Stepwise completion of $output makes
    this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
  - Removed use of performance thresholds in performance data when used disk io without subselect because threshold
    can only be used for on item not for all. Therefore they weren't checked in that section. Senseless.
 
- 24 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Changed all .= (for example $output .= $xxx.....) to = $var... (for example $output = $output . $xxx...). .= is shorter
    but the longer form of notification is better readable. The probability of overlooking the dot (especially for older eyes
    like mine) is smaller. 
 
- 07 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Changed "eval { require VMware::VIRuntime };" to "use VMware::VIRuntime;".  The eval construct 
    made no sense. If the module isn't available the program will crash with a compile error.
 
  - Removed own subroutine format_uptime() only used by host_uptime_info(). The complete work of this function
    was done converting seconds to days, hours etc.. Instead of the we use the perl module Time::Duration.
    So instead of
       $output = "uptime=" . format_uptime($value);
    we simply use
       $output =  "uptime=" . duration_exact($value);
 
  - Removed perfdata from host_uptime_info(). Perfdata for uptime seems senseless. Same for threshold.
  - Started modularization of the plugin. The reason is that it is much more easier to 
    patch modules than to patch a large file.
  - Variables used in that functions which are defined on the top level
    with "my" must now be defined with "our".
 
    BEWARE! Using "our" with unknown modules can lead to curious results if
    in this functions are variables with the same name. But in this 
    case it is no risk because the modules are not generic. We have only
    broken the plugin in handy pieces.
 
  - Made an seperate modules:
    - help.pm -> print_help()
    - process_perfdata.pm  -> get_key_metrices()
                           -> generic_performance_values()
                           -> return_host_performance_values()
                           -> return_host_vmware_performance_values()
                           -> return_cluster_performance_values()
                           -> return_host_temporary_vc_4_1_network_performance_values()
    - host_cpu_info.pm -> host_cpu_info()
    - host_mem_info.pm -> host_mem_info()
    - host_net_info.pm -> host_net_info()
    - host_disk_io_info.pm -> host_disk_io_info()
    - datastore_volumes_info.pm -> datastore_volumes_info()
    - host_list_vm_volumes_info.pm -> host_list_vm_volumes_info()
    - host_runtime_info.pm -> host_runtime_info()
    - host_service_info.pm -> host_service_info()
    - host_storage_info.pm -> host_storage_info()
    - host_uptime_info.pm -> host_uptime_info()

- 13 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Moved host_device_info to host_mounted_media_info. Opposite to it's name
    and the description this function wasn't designed to list all devices
    on a host. It was designed to show host cds/dvds mounted to one or more
    virtual machines. This is important for monitoring because a virtual machine
    with a mount cd or dvd drive can not be moved to another host.
  - Made an seperate modules:
    - host_mounted_media_info.pm -> host_mounted_media_info()

- 19 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Added SOAP check from Simon Meggle, Consol. Slightly modified to fit.
  - Added isblacklisted and isnotwhitelisted from Simon Meggle, Consol. . Same as above.
    Following subroutines or modules are affected:
    - datastore_volumes_info.pm
    - host_runtime_info.pm
  - Enhanced host_mounted_media_info.pm
    - Added check for host floppy
    - Added isblacklisted and isnotwhitelisted
    - Added $multiline

- 21 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Reformatted and cleaned up host_runtime_info().
  - A lot of bugs in it.

- 17 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau
  - Minor bug fix.
    - $subselect was always converted to lower case characters.
      This is correct exect $subselect contains a name (e.g. volumes). Volume names
      can contain upper and lower letters. Fixed.
    - datastore_volumes_info.pm had  my ($datastore, $subselect) = @_; as second line
      This was incorrect because "global" variables (defined as our in the main program)
      are not handled over via function call. (Yes - may be handling over maybe more ok 
      in the sense of structured programming. But really - does handling over and giving back 
      a variable makes the code so much clearer? More a kind of philosophy :-)) )
