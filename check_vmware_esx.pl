# History and Changes:
#
# - 22 Mar 2012 M.Fuerstenau
#   - Started with actual version 0.5.0
#   - Impelemented check_esx3new2.diff from Simon (simeg / simmerl)
#   - Reimplemented the changes of Markus Obstmayer for the actual version
#   - Comments within the code inform you about the changes
#   - It may happen that controllers has been found which are not active.
#     Therefor around line 2300        the following was added:
#
#     # M.Fuerstenau - additional to avoid using inactive controllers --------------
#      elsif (uc($dev->status) eq "3")
#            {
#            $status = 0;
#            }
#     #----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#           else
#            {
#            $state = 3;
#           }
#            $actual_state = Nagios::Plugin::Functions::max_state($actual_state, $status);
#            }
#            $perfdata = $perfdata . " adapters=" . $count . ";"$perf_thresholds . ";;";
#
#           # M.Fuerstenau - changed the output a little bit 
#           $output .= $count . " of " . @{$storage->storageDeviceInfo->hostBusAdapter} . " defined/possible adapters online, ";
#
# - 30 Mar 2012 M.Fuerstenau
#   - added --ignore_unknown. This maps 3 to 0. Why? You have for example several host adapters. Some are reported as
#     unknown by the plugin because they are not used or have not the capability to reports something senseful.
#
# - 02 Apr 2012 M.Fuerstenau
#   - _info (Adapter/LUN/Path). Removed perfdata. To count such items and display as perfdata doesn't make sense
#   - Changed PATH to MPATH and help from "path - list logical unit paths" to "mpath - list logical unit multipath info" because
#     it is NOT an information about a path - it is an information about multipathing.
#
# - 08 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau
#   - Removed installation informations for the perl SDK from VMware. This informations are part of the SDK and have nothing to do
#     with this plugin.
#   - Replaced global variables with my variables. Instead of "define every variable on the fly as needed it is a good practice
#     to define variables at the beginning and place a comment within it. It gives you better readability.
#
# - 22 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau
#   - Merged with the actual version from op5. Therfore all changes done to the op5 version:

#     Supported values are: r - realtime interval, h<number> - historical interval at position <number>, starting from 0.
#
#   - 2012-07-02  Kostyantyn Hushchyn

#
#   - 2012-07-26  Fixed issue which prevents plugin...   v2.8.8 v2.8.8-beta1 Kostyantyn Hushchyn
#     Fixed issue which prevents plugin from executing under EPN(Fixed issue #5796)

#     Fixed 'Global symbol normalizedPathState requires explicit package name'
#
#   - 2012-10-02  Kostyantyn Hushchyn
#     Changed timeshift argument type to integer, so that non number values will be treated as invalid.
#
#   - 2012-10-02  Kostyantyn Hushchyn
#     Changed to a conditional datastore refresh(Reduce overhead of solution suggested in issue #5787)
#
#   - 2012-10-05  Kostyantyn Hushchyn
#     Updated description so now almost all options are documented, though somewhere should be documented arguments like timeshift(-T),
#     max samples(-M) and interval(-i) (Solve ticket #5950)
#
######################################################################################################################################
#
#   General statement for all changes done by me:
#
#   Nagios, Icinga etc. are tools for
#
#   a) Alarming. That means checking values against thresholds (internal or handed over)
#   b) Collecting performance data. These data, collected with the checks, like network traffic, cpu usage or so should be
#      interpretable without a lot of other data.
#
#   So as a conclusion collecting historic performance data collected by a monitored system should not be done using Nagios,
#   pnp4nagios etc.. It should be interpreted with the appropriate admin tools of the relevant system. For vmware it means use
#   the (web)client for this and not Nagios. Same for performance counters not self explaining.
#
#   Example:
#   Monitoring swapped memory of a vmware guest system seems to makes sense. But on the second look it doesn't because on Nagios
#   you do not have the surrounding conditions in one view like
#   - the number of the running guest systems on the vmware server.
#   - the swap every guest system needs
#   - the total space allocated for all systems
#   - swap/memory usage of the hostcheck_vmware_esx.pl
#   - and a lot more
#
#   So monitoring memory of a host makes sense but the same for the guest via vmtools makes only a limited sense.

######################################################################################################################################
#
# - 31 Jan 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.1
#   - Replaced most die with a normal if statement and an exit.
#
# - 1 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.2
#   - Replaced unless with if. unless was only used eight times in the program. In all other statements we had an if statement
#     with the appropriate negotiation for the statement.
#
# - 5 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.3
#   - Replaced all add_perfdata statements with simple concatenated variable $perfdata
#
# - 6 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.4
#   - Corrected bug. Name of subroutine was sub check_percantage but this was a typo.
#
# - 7 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.5
#   - Replaced $percc and $percw with $crit_is_percent and $warn_versionis_percent. This was just cosmetic for better readability.
#   - Removed check_percentage(). It was replaced by two one liners directly in the code. Easier to read.
#   - The only codeblocks using check_percentage() were the blocks checking warning and critical. But unfortunately the
#     plausability check was not sufficient. Now it is tested that no other values than numbers and the % sign can be
#     submitted. It is also checked that in case of percent the values are in a valid level between 0 and 100
#
# - 12 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.8
#   - Replaced literals like CRITICAL with numerical values. Easier to type and anyone developing plugins should be
#     safe with the use
#   - Replaced $state with $actual_state and $res with $state. More for cosmetical issues but the state is returned
#     to Nagios.
#   - check_against_threshold from Nagios::Plugin replaced with a little own subroutine check_against_threshold.
#   - Nagios::Plugin::Functions::max_state replaced with own routine check_state
#
# - 14 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.9
#   - Replaced hash %STATUS_TEXT from Nagios::Plugin::Functions with own hash %status2text.
#
# - 15 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.10
#   - Own help (print_help()) and usage (print_usage()) function.
#   - Nagios::plugin kicked finally out.
#   - Mo more global variables.
#
# - 25 Feb 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.11
#   - $quickstats instead of $quickStats for better readability.
#
# - 5 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.12
#   - Removed return_cluster_DRS_recommendations() because for daily use this was more of an exotical feature
#   - Removed --quickstats for host_cpu_info and dc_cpu_info because quickstats is not a valid option here.
#
# - 6 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.13
#   - Replaced -o listitems with --listitems
#
# - 8 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.14
#   - --usedspace replaces -o used. $usedflag has been replaced by $usedflag.
#   - --listvms replaces -o listvm. $outputlist has been replaced by $listvms.
#   - --alertonly replaces -o brief. $briefflag has been replaced by $alertonly.
#   - --blacklistregexp replaces -o blacklistregexp. $blackregexpflag has been replaced by $blacklistregexp.
#   - --isregexp replaces -o regexp. $regexpflag has been replaced by $isregexp.
#
# - 9 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.15
#   - Main selection is now transfered to a subroutine main_select because after
#     a successfull if statement the rest can be skipped leaving the subroutine
#     with return
#
# - 19 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.16
#   - Reformatted and cleaned up a lot of code. Variable definitions are now at the beginning of each 
#     subroutine instead of defining them "on the fly" as needed with "my". Especially using "my" for
#     definition in a loop is not goog coding style
#
# - 21 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.17
#   - --listvms removed as extra switch. Ballooning or swapping VMs will always be listed.
#   - Changed subselect list(vm) to listvm for better readability. listvm was accepted  before (equal to list)
#     but not mentioned in the help. To have list or listvm for the same is a little bit exotic. Fixed this inconsistency.
#
# - 22 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.18
#   - Removed timeshift, interval and maxsamples. If needed use original program from op5.
#
# - 25 Mar 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.19
#   - Removed $defperfargs because no values will be handled over. Only performance check that needed another 
#     another sampling invel was cluster. This is now fix with 3000.
#     
# - 11 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.20
#   - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine host_mem_info. Removed $value1 - $value5. Stepwise completion of $output makes
#     this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
#
# - 16 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.21
#   - Stripped down vm_cpu_info. Monitoring CPU usage in Mhz makes no sense under normal circumstances
#     Mhz is no valid unit for performance data according to the plugin developer guide. I have never found
#     a reason to monitor wait time or ready time in a normal alerting evironment. This data has some interest
#     for performance analysis. But this can be done better with the vmware tools.
#   - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine vm_mem_info. Removed $value1 - $value5. Stepwise completion of $output makes
#     this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
#
# - 24 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.22
#   - Because there is a lot of different performance counters for memory in vmware we ave changed something to be 
#     more specific.
#     - Enhenced explanations in help.
#     - Changed swap to swapUSED in host_mem_info().
#     - Changed usageMB to CONSUMED in host_mem_info(). Same for variables.
#     - Removed overall in host_mem_info(). After reading the documentation carefully the addition of consumed.average + overhead.average
#       seems a little bit senseless because consumed.average includes overhead.average.
#     - Changed usageMB to CONSUMED in vm_mem_info(). Same for variables.
#     - Removed swapIN and swapOUT in vm_mem_info(). Not so sensefull for Nagios alerting because it is hard to find 
#       valid thresholds
#     - Removed swap in vm_mem_info(). From the vmware documentation:
#       "Current amount of guest physical memory swapped out to the virtual machine's swap file by the VMkernel. Swapped 
#        memory stays on disk until the virtual machine needs it. This statistic refers to VMkernel swapping and not
#        to guest OS swapping. swapped = swapin + swapout"
#
#       This is more an issue of performance tuning rather than alerting. It is not swapping inside the virtual machine.
#       it is not possible to do any alerting here because (especially with vmotion) you have no thresholds.
#     - Removed OVERHEAD in vm_mem_info(). From the vmware documentation:
#       "Amount of machine memory used by the VMkernel to run the virtual machine."
#       So using this we have a useless information about a virtual machine because we have no valid context and we 
#       have no valid thresholds. More important is overhead for the host system. And if we are running in problems here
#       we have to look which machine must be moved to another host. 
#     - As a result of this overall in vm_mem_info() makes no sense.
#
# - 25 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.23
#   - Removed swap in vm_mem_info(). From vmware documentation:
#     "Amount of guest physical memory that is currently reclaimed from the virtual machine through ballooning.
#      This is the amount of guest physical memory that has been allocated and pinned by the balloon driver."
#     So here we have again data which makes no sense used alone. You need the context for interpreting them
#     and there are no thresholds for alerting.
#
# - 29 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.24
#   - Renamed $esx to $esx_server. This is only for cosmetics and better reading of the code.
#   - Reimplmented subselect ready in vm_cpu_info and implemented it new in host_cpu_info.
#     From the vmware documentation:
#     "Percentage of time that the virtual machine was ready, but could not get scheduled
#      to run on the physical CPU. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of virtual
#      machines on the host and their CPU loads."
#     High or growing ready time can be a hint CPU bottlenecks (host and guest system)
#   - Reimplmented subselect wait in vm_cpu_info and implemented it new in host_cpu_info.
#     From the vmware documentation:
#     "CPU time spent in wait state. The wait total includes time spent the CPU Idle, CPU Swap Wait,
#      and CPU I/O Wait states. "
#     High or growing wait time can be a hint I/O bottlenecks (host and guest system)
#
# - 30 Apr 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.25
#   - Removed subroutines return_dc_performance_values, dc_cpu_info, dc_mem_info, dc_net_info and dc_disk_io_info.
#     Monitored entity was view type HostSystem. This means, that the CPU of the data center server is monitored.
#     The data center server (vcenter) is either a physical MS Windows serversionver (which can be monitored better
#     directly with SNMP and/or NSClient++) or the new Linux based appliance which is a virtual machine and
#     can be monitored as any virtual machine. The OS (Linux) on that virtual machine can be monitored like
#     any standard Linux.
#
# - 5 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.26
#   - Revised the code of dc_list_vm_volumes_info()
#
# - 9 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.27
#   - Revised the code of host_net_info(). The function was devided in two parts (like others):
#     - subselects
#     - else which included all.
#     So most of the code existed twice. One for each subselect and nearly the same for all together.
#     The else block was removed and in case no subselect was defined we defined all as $subselect.
#     With the variable set to all we can decide wether to leave the function after a subselect section
#     has been processed or stay and enhance $output and $perfdata. So the code is more clear and
#     has nearly half the lines of code left.
#   - Removed KBps as unit in performance data. This unit is not specified in the plugin developer 
#     guide. Performance data is now just a number without a unit. Adding the unit has to be done 
#     in the graphing tool (like pnp4nagios).
#   - Removed the number of NICs as performance data. A little bit senseless to have those data here.
#
# - 10 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.27
#   - Revised the code of vm_net_info(). Same changes as for host_net_info() exept the NIC section.
#     This is not available for VMs.
#
# - 14 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.28
#   - Replaced $command and $subselect with $select and $subselect. Therfore also the options --command
#     --subselect changed to --select and --subselect. This has been done to become it more clear.
#     In fact these items where no commands (or subselects). It were selections from the amount of
#     performance counters available in vmware.
#
# - 15 May 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.29
#   - Kicked out all (I hope so) code for processing historic data from generic_performance_values().
#     generic_performance_values() is called by return_host_performance_values(), return_host_vmware_performance_values()
#     and return_cluster_performance_values() (return_cluster_performance_values() must be rewritten now).
#     The code length of generic_performance_values() was reduced to one third by doing this.
#
# - 6 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.30
#   - Substituted commandline option for select -l with -S. Therefore -S can't be used as option for the sessionfile
#     Only --sessionfile is accepted nor the name of the sessionfile.
#   - Corrected some bugs in check_against_threshold()
#   - Ensured that in case of thresholds critical must be greater than warning.
#
# - 11 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.31
#   - Changed select option for datastore from vmfs to volumes because we will have volumes on nfs AND vmfs on local or
#     SAN disks. 
#   - Changed output for datastore check to use the option --multiline. This will add a \n (unset -> default) for 
#     every line of output. If set it will use HTML tag <br>.
#
#     The option --multiline sets a <br> tag instead of \n. This must be filtered out
#     before using the output in notifications like an email. sed will do the job:
#
#     sed 's/<[Bb][Rr]>/&\n/g' | sed 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
#
#     Example:
#
#    # 'notify-by-email' command definition
#    define command{
#    	command_name	notify-by-email
#    	command_line	/usr/bin/printf "%b" "Message from Nagios:\n\nNotification Type: $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$\n\nService: $SERVICEDESC$\nHost: $HOSTNAME$\nHostalias: $HOSTALIAS$\nAddress: $HOSTADDRESS$\nState: $SERVICESTATE$\n\nDate/Time: $SHORTDATETIME$\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n$SERVICEOUTPUT$\n$LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$" | sed 's/<[Bb][Rr]>/&\n/g' | sed 's/<[^<>]*>//g' | /bin/mail -s "** $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ alert - $HOSTNAME$/$SERVICEDESC$ is $SERVICESTATE$ **" $CONTACTEMAIL$
#    	}
#
# - 13 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.32
#   - Replaced a previous change because it was wrong done:
#     - --listvms replaced by subselect listvms
#
# - 14 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.33
#   - Some minor corrections like a doubled chop() in datastore_volumes_info()
#   - Added volume type to datastore_volumes_info(). So you can see whether the volume is vmfs (local or SAN) or NFS.
#   - variables like $subselect or $blacklist are global there is no need to handle them over to subroutines like
#     ($result, $output) = vm_cpu_info($vmname, local_uc($subselect)) . For $subselect we have now one uppercase
#     (around line 580) instead of having one with each call in the main selection.
#   - Later on I renamed local_uc to local_lc because I recognized that in cases the subselect is a volume name
#     upper cases won't work.
#   - replaced last -o $addopts (only for the name of a sensor) with --sensorname
#
# - 18 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.34
#   - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine host_disk_io_info(). Removed $value1 - $value7. Stepwise completion of $output makes
#     this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
#   - Removed use of performance thresholds in performance data when used disk io without subselect because threshold
#     can only be used for one item not for all. Therefore they weren't checked in that section. Senseless.
#   - Changed the output. Opposite to vm_disk_io_info() most values in host_disk_io_info() are not transfer rates
#     but latency in milliseconds. The output is now clearly understandable.
#   - Added subselect read. Average number of kilobytes read from the disk each second. Rate at which data is read
#     from each LUN on the host.read rate = # blocksRead per second x blockSize.
#   - Added subselect write. Average number of kilobytes written to disk each second. Rate at which data is written
#     to each LUN on the host.write rate = # blocksRead per second x blockSize
#   - Added subselect usage. Aggregated disk I/O rate. For hosts, this metric versionincludes the rates for all virtual
#     machines running on the host.
#
# - 21 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.35
#   - Rewritten and cleaned subroutine vm_disk_io_info(). Removed $value1 - $valuen. Stepwise completion of $output makes
#     this unsophisticated construct obsolete.
#   - Removed use of performance thresholds in performance data when used disk io without subselect because threshold
#     can only be used for on item not for all. Therefore they weren't checked in that section. Senseless.
#
# - 24 Jun 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.7.36
#   - Changed all .= (for example $output .= $xxx.....) to = $var... (for example $output = $output . $xxx...). .= is shorter
#     but the longer form of notification is better readable. The probability of overlooking the dot (especially for older eyes
#     like mine) is smaller. 
#
# - 07 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.0
#   - Changed "eval { require VMware::VIRuntime };" to "use VMware::VIRuntime;".  The eval construct 
#     made no sense. If the module isn't available the program will crash with a compile error.
#
#   - Removed own subroutine format_uptime() only used by host_uptime_info(). The complete work of this function
#     was done converting seconds to days, hours etc.. Instead of the we use the perl module Time::Duration.
#     So instead of
#        $output = "uptime=" . format_uptime($value);
#     we simply use
#        $output =  "uptime=" . duration_exact($value);
#
#   - Removed perfdata from host_uptime_info(). Perfdata for uptime seems senseless. Same for threshold.
#   - Started modularization of the plugin. The reason is that it is much more easier to 
#     patch modules than to patch a large file.
#   - Variables used in that functions which are defined on the top level
#     with "my" must now be defined with "our".
#
#     BEWARE! Using "our" with unknown modules can lead to curious results if
#     in this functions are variables with the same name. But in this 
#     case it is no risk because the modules are not generic. We have only
#     broken the plugin in handy pieces.
#
#   - Made an seperate modules:
#     - help.pm -> print_help()
#     - process_perfdata.pm  -> get_key_metrices()
#                            -> generic_performance_values()
#                            -> return_host_performance_values()
#                            -> return_host_vmware_performance_values()
#                            -> return_cluster_performance_values()
#                            -> return_host_temporary_vc_4_1_network_performance_values()
#     - host_cpu_info.pm -> host_cpu_info()
#     - host_mem_info.pm -> host_mem_info()
#     - host_net_info.pm -> host_net_info()
#     - host_disk_io_info.pm -> host_disk_io_info()
#     - datastore_volumes_info.pm -> datastore_volumes_info()
#     - host_list_vm_volumes_info.pm -> host_list_vm_volumes_info()
#     - host_runtime_info.pm -> host_runtime_info()
#     - host_service_info.pm -> host_service_info()
#     - host_storage_info.pm -> host_storage_info()
#     - host_uptime_info.pm -> host_uptime_info()
#
# - 13 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.1
#   - Moved host_device_info to host_mounted_media_info. Opposite to it's name
#     and the description this function wasn't designed to list all devices
#     on a host. It was designed to show host cds/dvds mounted to one or more
#     virtual machines. This is important for monitoring because a virtual machine
#     with a mount cd or dvd drive can not be moved to another host.
#   - Made an seperate modules:
#     - host_mounted_media_info.pm -> host_mounted_media_info()
#
# - 19 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.2
#   - Added SOAP check from Simon Meggle, Consol. Slightly modified to fit.
#   - Added isblacklisted and isnotwhitelisted from Simon Meggle, Consol. . Same as above.
#     Following subroutines or modules are affected:
#     - datastore_volumes_info.pm
#     - host_runtime_info.pm
#   - Enhanced host_mounted_media_info.pm
#     - Added check for host floppy
#     - Added isblacklisted and isnotwhitelisted
#     - Added $multiline
#
# - 21 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.3
#   - Reformatted and cleaned up host_runtime_info().
#   - A lot of bugs in it.
#
# - 17 Aug 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.4
#   - Minor bug fix.
#     - $subselect was always converted to lower case characters.
#       This is correct exect $subselect contains a name (e.g. volumes). Volume names
#       can contain upper and lower letters. Fixed.
#     - datastore_volumes_info.pm had  my ($datastore, $subselect) = @_; as second line
#       This was incorrect because "global" variables (defined as our in the main program)
#       are not handled over via function call. (Yes - may be handling over maybe more ok 
#       in the sense of structured programming. But really - does handling over and giving back 
#       a variable makes the code so much clearer? More a kind of philosophy :-)) )
#
# - 27 Oct 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.5
#   - Made an seperate modules:
#     - vm_cpu_info.pm -> vm_cpu_info()
#     - vm_mem_info.pm -> vm_mem_info()
#     - dc_list_vm_volumes_info.pm -> dc_list_vm_volumes_info()
#     - vm_net_info.pm -> vm_net_info()
#     - vm_disk_io_info.pm -> vm_disk_io_info()
#
# - 31 Oct 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.9
#   - Readded -V|--version to display the version number.
#
# - 01 Nov 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.10
#   - removed return_host_temporary_vc_4_1_network_performance_values() from
#     process_perfdata.pm. Not needed in ESX version 5 and above.
#     Affected subroutine:
#     host_net_info().
#   - Bug fixed in generic_performance_values(). Unfortunaltely I had moved
#     my @values = () to main function. Therefore instead of containing a 
#     new array reference with each run the new references were added to the array
#     but only the first one was processed. Thanks to Timo Weber for discovering this bug.
#
# - 20 Nov 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.11
#   - check_state(). Bugfix. Logical error. Complete rewrite.
#   - host_net_info()
#     - Minor bugfix. Added exit 2 in case of unallowed thresholds
#     - Simplified the output. Instead of doing it for every subselect (or not
#       if subselect=all for selecting all info) we have a new helper variable
#       called $true_sub_sel.
#       0 means not a true subselect.
#       1 means a true subselect (including all)
#   - host_runtime_info().
#     - Filtered out the sensor type "software components". Makes no sense for alerting.
#     - The complete else tree (no subselect) was scrap due to the fact that the return code
#       was always ok. There would never be any alarm. Kicked out.
#     - The else tree was replaced by a $subselect=all as in host_net_info().
#     - Same for output.
#     - subselect listvms.
#       - The (OK) in the output was a hardcoded. Replaced by the deliverd value (UP). (in my oipinion senseless)
#       - Removed perfdata. The number of virtual machines as perfdata doesn't
#         make so much sense.
#     - Rearranged the order of subselects. Must be the same as the statements
#       in the kicked out else sequence to get the same order in output
#     - connection state.
#
#       From the docs:
#       connected      Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is always
#                      the setting.
#       disconnected   The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter
#                      does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The
#                      next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to
#                      the connected state again and an event is logged.
#       notResponding  VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server
#                    . The state automatically changes to connected once
#                      heartbeats are received again. This state is typically
#                      used to trigger an alarm on the host. 
#
#       In the past the presset of returncode was 2. It was set to 0 in case of a
#       connected. But disconnected doesn' mean a critical error. It means main-
#       tenance or somesting like that. Therefore we now return a 1 for warning.
#       notResonding will cause a 2 for critical.
#     - Kicked out maintenance info in runtime summary and as subselect. In the beginning of
#       the function is a check for maintenance. In the original program in this case
#       the program will be left with a die which caused a red alert in Nagios. Now an info 
#       is displayed and a return code of 1 (warning) is deliverd because a maintenance is
#       regular work. Although monitoring should take notice of it. Therefore a warning.
#       Therefor the maintenence check in the else tree was scrap. It was never reached.
#     - listvms
#       In case of no VMs the plugin returned a critical. But this is not correct. No VMs
#       on a host is not an error. It is simply what it says: No VMs.
#     - Replaced --listitems and --listall with --listsensors because there were two options
#       for the same use.
#     - Later on I decided to kick out the complete sensorname construction. To monitor a seperate sensor
#       by name (a string which ist different for each sensor) seems not to make so much sense. To monitor
#       sensors by type gave no usefull information (exept temperature which is still monitored. All usefull
#       informations are in the health section. Better to implement some out here if needed.
#       renamed -s temperature to -s temp (because I am lazy).
#     - Changed output of --listsensors. | is the seperation symbol for performance data. So it should not be
#       used in output strings.
#     - Same for the error output of sensors in case of a problem.
#     - subselect=health. Filter out sensors which have not valid data. Often a sensor is
#       reckognizedby vmware but has not the ability to report something senseful. In this
#       case an unknown is reported and the message "Cannot report on the current health state of
#       the element". This it can be skipped.
#   - Bugfix for vm_net_info(). It worked perfectly for -H but produced bullshit with the -D option.
#     With -D in PerfQuerySpec->new(...) intervalId and maxSample must be set. Default was 20 for intervalId
#     and 1 for maxSample
#   - datastore_volumes_info()
#     - New option --gigabyte
#     - Fixed bug for treating name as regexp (--isregexp).
#     - Fixed bug in perfdata (%:MB). Is now MB or GB.
#     - If no single volume is selected warning/critical threshold can be given
#       only in percent.
#   - Fixed bug in regexp for blacklists and whitelists and replace --blacklistregexp and --whitelistregexp with
#     --isregexp. Used in
#       - host_mounted_media_info()
#       - datastore_volumes_info()
#       - host_runtime_info()
#     All subroutines revised later will include it automatically
#   - Fixed bug in regexp for blacklists and whitelists and replace --blacklistregexp and --whitelistregexp with
#   - Opposite to the op5 original blacklists and whitelists can now contain true reular expressions.
#   - help.pm rewritten. It was too much output. Now the user has several choices:
#     -h|--help=<all>                    The complete help for all.
#     -h|--help=<dc|datacenter|vcenter>  Help for datacenter/vcenter checks.
#     -h|--help=<host>                   Help for vmware host checks.
#     -h|--help=<vm>                     Help for virtual machines checks.
#     -h|--help=<cluster>                Help for cluster checks.
#   - host_service_info() rewritten.
#     - No longer a list of services via subselect.
#     - Instead full blacklist/whitelist support
#     - With --isregexp blacklist/whitelist items are interpreted as regular expressions
#   - Changed switch of blacklist from -x to -B
#   - Changed switch of whitelist from -y to -W
#   - main_select(). Something for the scatterbrained of us. Replaced string compare (eq,ne etc.) with
#     a regexp pattern matching. So it is possible to type in services or Services instead of service.
#
# - 29 Nov 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.13
#   - In all functions checking host for maintenance we had the following contruction:
#
#     if (uc($host_view->get_property('runtime.inMaintenanceMode')) eq "TRUE")
#
#     This is quite stupid. runtime.inMaintenanceMode is xsd:boolean wich means true or false (in 
#     lower cas letters. So a uc() make no sense. Removed
#
#   - Bypass SSL certificate validation - thanks Robert Karliczek for the hint
#   - Added --sslport if any port other port than 443 is wanted. 443 is used as default.
#   - Rewritten authorization part. Sessionfiles are working now.
#   - Updated README.
#
# - 03 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.14
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - Fixed minor bug. In case of an unknown with sensors the unknown was always mapped to
#       a warning. This wasn't sensefull under all circumstances. Now it is only mapped to warning
#       if --ignoreunknow is not set.
#   - README
#     - Updated installation notes
#   - Optional pathname for sessionfile
#
# - 10 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.15
#   - datastore_volumes_info()
#     - Changed "For all volumes" to "For all selected volumes". This should fit all. The subroutine datastore_volumes_info
#       is called from several subroutines and to make a difference here for a single volume or more volumes will cause
#       a lot of unnecessary work just for cosmetics.
#     - Fixed typo in error message.
#     - Modified error messages
#   - Removed plausibility check whether critical must be greater than warning. In case of freespace for example it must
#     be the other way round. The plausibility check was nice but too complicated for all the different conditions.
#   - check_against_threshold() - Cleaned up and partially rewritten.
#
# - 12 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.16
#   - datastore_volumes_info()
#     - Some small fixes
#       - Changed the output for OK from  "For all selected volumes" to "OK for all seleted volumes."
#       -  Same for error plus an error counter for the alarms
#     - Parameter usedspace was ignored on volume checks because a local variable defined with my instead of a more global
#       one. Changed it from my to our fixed it. Thanks to dgoetz for reporting (and fixing) this.
#     - Capacity is now displayed and deliverd as perfdata
#   - Main selection - GetOptions. Unce upon a time I had kicked out $timeout unintended. Fixed now. Thanks to 
#     Andreas Daubner for the hint.
#
# - 12 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.17
#   - host_net_info()
#     - Changed output
#     - Added total number of NICs
#
# - 13 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.8.18
#   - host_mounted_media()
#     - Delivers now a warning instead of a critical
#
# - 25 Dec 2013 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.0
#   - help()
#     - Removed -v/--verbose. The code was not debugging the plugin but not for working with it.
#   - host_storage_info()
#     - Removed optional switch for adaptermodel. Displaying the adapter model is default now.
#     - Removed upper case conversion for status. The status was converted (for examplele online to ONLINE) and
#       compared with a upper case string like "ONLINE". Sensefull like a second asshole.
#     - Added working blacklist/whitelist.
#       - Blacklist: blacklisted adapters will not be displayed.
#       - Whitelist: only whitelisted adapters will be displayed.
#     - Removed perfdata for the number of hostbusadapters. These perfdata was absolutely senseless.     
#     - Status for hostbusadapters was not checked correctly. The check was only done for online and unknown but NOT(!!)
#       for offline and unbound.
#     - LUN states were not correct. UNKNOWN is not a valid state. Not all states different from unknown are 
#       supposed to be critical. From the docs:
#
#       degraded             One or more paths to the LUN are down, but I/O is still possible. Further
#                            path failures may result in lost connectivity.
#       error                The LUN is dead and/or not reachable.
#       lostCommunication    No more paths are available to the LUN.
#       off                  The LUN is off.
#       ok                   The LUN is on and available.
#       quiesced             The LUN is inactive.
#       timeout              All Paths have been down for the timeout condition determined by a
#                            user-configurable host advanced option.
#       unknownState         The LUN state is unknown.
#
#     - Removed number of LUNs as perfdata. Senseless (again).
#     - In the original selection for the displayed LUN the displayName was used first, then the deviceName and
#       the last one was the canonical name. Unfortunately in the GUI SCSI ID, canonical name an runtime name is
#       displayed. So using the freely configurable DisplayName is senseless. The device name is formed from the
#       path (/vmfs/devices/disks/) followed by the canonical name. So it is either senseless.
#     - The real numeric LUN number wasn'nt display. Fixed. Output is now LUN, canonical name, everything from
#       the display name not equal canonical name and status.  
#     - Complete rewrite of the paths part. Only the state of the multipath was checked but not the state of the
#       paths. So a multipath can be "Active" which is ok but the second line is dead. So if the active path becomes
#       dead the failover won't work.There must be an alarm for a standby path too. It is now grouped in the output.
#     - Multiline support for this.
#
# - 03 Jan 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.1
#   - check_vmware_esx.pl
#     Added new flag --ignore_warning. This will map a warning to ok.
#   - host_runtime_info() - some minor changes
#     - Changed state to powerstate. In the original version the power state was mapped:
#       poweredOn => UP
#       poweredOff => DOWN
#       suspended => SUSPENDED
#       This suggested a machine state but it is only a powerstate. All other than UP caused a critical. But this is 
#       not true. A power off machine can also be ok. But to be sure that it is noticed we will have a warning for
#       powerd off and suspended
#     - Perfdata changed.
#       - vm_up -> vm_powerdon
#       - New: vm_poweroff
#       - New: vm_suspended
#   - vm_runtime_info() -> vm_runtime_info.pm
#     - Removed a lot of unnecessary variables and hashes. Rewritten a lot.
#     - Connection state. Only "connected" was checked. All other caused a critical error without a usefull message.
#       This wa a little bit incomplete. Corrected. States delivered from VMware are connected, disconnected,
#       inaccessible, invalid and orphaned.
#     - Removed cpu. VirtualMachineRuntimeInfo maxCpuUsage (in Mhz) doesn't make so much sense for monitoring/alerting.
#       See VMware docs for further information for this performance counter.
#     - Removed mem. VirtualMachineRuntimeInfo maxMemoryUsage doesn't make so much sense for monitoring/alerting.
#       See VMware docs for further information for this performance counter.
#     - Changed state to powerstate. In the original version the power state was mapped:
#       poweredOn => UP
#       poweredOff => DOWN
#       suspended => SUSPENDED
#       This suggested a machine state but it is only a powerstate. All other than UP caused a critical. But this is 
#       not true. A power off machine can also be ok. But to be sure that it is noticed we will have a warning for
#       powerd off and suspended
#     - Changed guest to gueststate. This is more descriptive.
#       Removed mapping in guest state. Mapping was "running" => "Running", "notrunning" => "Not running",
#       "shuttingdown" => "Shutting down", "resetting" => "Resetting", "standby" => "Standby", "unknown" => "Unknown".
#       This was not necessary from a technical point of view. The original messages are clearly understandable.
#     - The guest states were not interpreted correctly. In check_vmware_api.pl all states different from running
#       caused a "Critical" error. But this is nonsense. A planned shutted down machine is not an error. It's daily
#       business. But the operator should probably have a notice of that. So it causing a "Warning".
#
#       The states are (from the docs):
#       running      -> Guest is running normally. (returns 0)
#       shuttingdown -> Guest has a pending shutdown command. (returns 1)
#       resetting    -> Guest has a pending reset command. (returns 1)
#       standby      -> Guest has a pending standby command. (returns 1)
#       notrunning   -> Guest is not running. (returns 1)
#       unknown      -> Guest information is not available. (returns 3)
#
#     - Rewritten subselect tools. VirtualMachineToolsStatus was deprecated. As of vSphere API 4.0
#       VirtualMachineToolsVersionStatus and VirtualMachineToolsRunningStatus
#       has to be used. So a great part of this subselect was not working.
#   - vm_disk_io_info()
#     - Minor bug in output and perfdata corrected. I/O is not in MB but in MB/s. Some
#       of the counters were in MB.
#     - Corrected help. The original on was nonsense.
#     - Changed all values to KB/s because so it is equal to host disk I/O and so it
#       it is deleverd from the API.
#   - help()
#     - Some small bug fixes.
#   - host_disk_io_info()
#     - added total_latency.
#
# - 08 Jan 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.2
#   - help()
#     - Some small bug fixes.
#   - vm_disk_io_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#   - host_disk_io_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#     - Bug fix. Usage was given without subselect but missing as subselect. Not
#       detected earlier due to the duplicate code.
#   - host_cpu_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#     - Added usage as subselect.
#   - vm_cpu_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#     - Added usage as subselect.
#   - host_mem_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#     - swapused
#       - I swapused is a subselect there should be enhanced information about
#         the virtual machines and should be available. If this won't work
#         nothing will happen. In the past this caused a critical error which
#         is nonsense here.
#      - memctl
#        - Same as swapused
#   - vm_mem_info()
#     - Removed duplicated code. (if subselect ..... else ....)
#       The code was 90% identical.
#     - Added vmmemctl.average (memctl) to monitor balloning.
#
# - 16 Jan 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.3
#   - All modules
#     - Corrected typo at the end. common instead of commen
#   - host_storage_info()

#       - %host_state_strings was mostly nonsense. The mapped poser states from

#         power states from the system (from the docs):
#         - poweredOff -> The host was specifically powered off by the user
#                         through VirtualCenter. This state is not a certain
#                         state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command
#                         to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill
#                         all the processes but fail to power off.
#         - poweredOn  -> The host is powered on
#         - standBy    -> The host was specifically put in standby mode, either
#                         explicitly by the user, or automatically by DPM. This
#                         state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter
#                         issues the command to put the host in stand-by state,
#                         the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail
#                         to power off.
#         - unknown    -> If the host is disconnected, or notResponding, we can
#                         not possibly have knowledge of its power state. Hence,
#                         the host is marked as unknown.

# - 24 Jan 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.4
#   - Merged pull request from Sven Nierlein
#     - Modified hel to work with Thruk
#     - Added Makefile. This is optional. Calling it generates a single file

#       and not a warning
#
# - 06 Feb 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.7
#   - Bugfixes/Enhancements
#     - In some cases it might happen that no performance counters are delivered
#       by VMware. Especially if the version is old (4.x, 3.x). Under these
#       circumstances an undef was returned by the routines from process_perfdata.pm
#       and not handled correctly in the calling subroutines. Fixed.
#       Affected subroutines:
#       - host_cpu_info()
#       - vm_net_info()
#       - vm_mem_info()
#       - vm_net_info()
#       - vm_disk_io_info()
#       - vm_cpu_info()
#       - host_net_info()
#       - host_mem_info()
#       - host_disk_io_info()
#   - vm_net_info()
#     - Rewritten to the same structure as similar modules
#   - host_net_info()
#     - Rewritten to the same structure as similar modules
#
# - 24 Feb 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.8
#   - Corrected a type in the help()
#   - Moved the block for constructing the full path of the sessionfile downward to the authentication
#     stuff to have all in one place.
#   - Authentication:
#     - To reduce amounts of login/logout events in the vShpere logfiles or a lot of open sessions using
#       sessionfiles the login part has been rewritten. Using session files is now the default. Only one
#       session file per host or vCenter is used as default
#
#       The sessionfile name is automatically set to the vSphere host or the vCenter (IP or name - whatever
#       is used in the check).
#
#       Multiple sessions are possible using different session file names. To form different session file
#       names the default name is enhenced by the value you set with --sessionfile.
#
#       NOTICE! All checks using the same session are serialized. So a lot of checks using only one session
#       can cause timeouts. In this case you should enhence the number of sessions by using --sessionfile
#       in the command definition and define the value in the service definition command as an extra argument
#       so it can be used in the command definition as $ARGn$.
#     - --sessionfile is now optional and only used to enhance the sessionfile name to have multiple sessions.
#     - If a session logs in it sets a lock file (sessionfilename_locked).
#     - The lock file is been set when the session starts and removed at the end of the plugin run.
#     - A newly started check looks for the lock file and waits until it is no longer there. So here we
#       have a serialization now. It will not hang forever due to the alarm routine.
#     - Fixed bug "Can't call method "unset_logout_on_disconnect"". I mixed object orientated code and classical
#       code. (Thanks copy & paste for this bug)
#   - $timeout set to 40 seconds instead of 30 to have a little longer waiting before automatic cancelling
#     the check to prevent unwanted cancelling due to longer waiting caused by serialization.
#
# - 25 Feb 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.9
#   - Bugfix and improvement for "lost" lock files. In case of a Nagios reload (or kill -HUP) Nagios is restarted with the
#     same PID as before. Unfortunately Nagios sends a SIGINT or SIGTERM to the plugins. This causes the plugin
#     to terminate without removing the lockfile.
#     - So we have to catch several signals now
#       - SIGINT and SIGTERM. One of this will be send from Nagios 
#       - SIGALRM. Caused by alarm(). Now with output usable in Nagios.
#     - Instead of generating an empty file as lock file we write the process identifier of the running plugin
#       process into the lock file. If a session crashes for some reason an a lock file is left we are in a 
#       situation where signal processing won't help. But here the next run of the plugin reads the PID and checks
#       for the process. If there is no process anymore it will remove the lock file and create a new one.
#       Thanks to Simon Meggle, Consol, for the idea.
#   - Removed "die" for opening the authfile or the session lock file with an unless construct. The plugin will
#     report an "understandable" message to the monitor instead of causing an internal error code.
#   - vm_cpu_info() and host_cpu_info()
#     - Removed threshold for ready and wait. Therefore thresholds are no possible 
#       without subselect.
#
# - 26 Feb 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.10
#   - Bugfixes.
#     - Corrected typo in dc_runtime_info() line 660.
#     - Corrected typo in help().
#     - Corrected bug in datastore_volumes_info(). Giving absolute thresholds
#       for a single volume was not possible. Fixed.
#   - Removed print_usage(). Due to mass of parameters it is not possible to display
#     a short usage message. Instead of that the output of the help is included
#     in the package as a file.
#   - Updated default timeout to 90 secs. to avoid timeouts.
#   - Before accessing the session file (and lock file) we have a random sleep up
#     7 secs.. This is to avoid a concurrent access in case of a monitor restart
#     or a "Schedule a check of all services on this host"
#   - In case of a locked session file the wait loop is not fix to 1 sec any more.
#     Instead of this it uses a random period up to 5 sec.. So we minimize the risc
#     of concurrent access.
#
# - 7 Mar 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.11
#   - Updated README
#     - Section for removing HTML tags was reworked
#   - Added blacklist to host_net_info() so that interfaces with -S net can
#     be blacklisted.
#
# - 11 Mar 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.12
#   - Changed sleep() to usleep() and using now microseconds instead of seconds
#   - So before accessing the session file (and lock file) we now have a random sleep
#     up to 1500 milliseconds (default - see $ms_ts). This is to avoid a concurrent access
#     in case of a monitor restart or a "Schedule a check of all services on this host"
#     but takes much less time while having much more alternatives.
#   - In case of a locked session file the wait loop is not fix to a random period up to
#     5 sec. any more. Instead of this it uses also $ms_ts which means a max of 1.5 secs.
#     instead of 5.
#
# - 3 Apr 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.13
#   - --trace=<tracelevel> was not working. Fixed. Small typo.
#   - Removed comment sign in front of unlink around. It was there due to some
#     some tests and I had forgotten to remove it.
#   - datastore_volumes_info(). Some bugs corrected.
#     - Wrong percent calculation
#     - Wrong processing of thresholds for usedspace
#     - Wrong processing for thresholds which are not percent
#     - If threshold is in percent it is calculated in MB/GB for perfdata
#       because mixing percent and MB/GB doesn't make sense.
#
# - 5 Apr 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.14
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - Fixed some bugs with issues ignored and whitelist. Some counters were calculated
#       wrong
#
# - 29 Apr 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.15
#   - host_mem_info(), vm_mem_info(), host_cpu_info() and vm_cpu_info().
#     - Sometimes it may happen on Vmware 5.5 (not seen when testing with Update 1) that getting
#       the perfdata for cpu and/or memory will result in an empty construct because one
#       or more values are not delivered. In this case we have a fallback and and every value
#   - dc_runtime_info()
#     - New option --poweredonly to list only machines which are powered on
#
# - 20 May 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.16
#   - New option --nosession.
#     - This was implemented for 2 reasons.
#       - First when testing from the commandline using this switch to avoid
#         waiting and timeouts while the monitor system is checking the the same host.
#         This is the important reason.
#       - Second is that some people don't like sessionfiles and prefer full logs as
#         it was in the past. Good ol' times.
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - added --nostoragestatus to -S runtime -s health to avoid a double alarm
#       when also doing a check with -S runtime -s storagehealth for the same
#       host.
#   - dc_runtime_info()
#     - changed 
#       if (($subselect eq "listcluster") || ($subselect eq "all"))
#       to
#       if (($subselect =~ m/listcluster.*$/) || ($subselect eq "all"))
#       This is to avoid unnecessary typos because it covers listcluster and listclusters ;-)
#   - datastore_volumes_info()
#     -  Heavily reworked lot of the logical structure. There were too much changes
#        changes after changes which lead to bugs. Now it is cleaned up.
#   - cluster_list_vm_volumes_info()
#     - Seperate module now
#   - cluster_cpu_info()
#     - Seperate module now but still not working.
#
# - 1 Jul 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.16a
#   - Unfortunately published some modules containing debugging outpu. Fixed.
#     - host_disk_io_info.pm
#     - process_perfdata.pm
#     - vm_disk_io_info.pm
#
# - 20 Jul 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.17
#   - Removing the last multiline character (\n or <br>) was moved
#     from several subroutines to the main exit in check_vmware_esx.pl. 
#     This was based this was implemented based on a proposal of Dietmar Eberth
#     Affected subroutines:
#     - vm_runtime_info()
#     - host_storage_info()
#     - host_runtime_info()
#     - dc_runtime_info()
#     -datastore_volumes_info()
#   - Fixed a bug on line 139 and 172. Thanks for fixing it to Dietmar Eberth.
#     - Instead of 
#     
#       if ( $state >= 0 )
#          {
#          $alertcnt++;
#          }
#         
#       it must be:
#
#       if ( $alertcnt > 0 )
#          {
#          $alertcnt++;
#          }
#
#   - Fixed a bug on line 139 and 172. Thanks for fixing it to Dietmar Eberth.
#   - If only one volume is selected we have a better output now. Also thanks
#     to Dietmar Eberth.
#
# - 21 Jul 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.17a
#   - Bugfix line 139 and 172 (now 140 and 173). It must be 
#
#     if ( $actual_state > 0 )
#
#     instead of
#
#     if ( $alertcnt > 0
#
# - 25 Jul 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.18
#   - New option --perf_free_space for checking volumes. It must be used 
#     with --usedspace. In versions prior to 0.9.18 perfdata was always 
#     deliverd as free space even if --usedspace was selected. From 0.9.18
#     on when using --usedspace perfdata is recorded as used space. To prevent
#     old perfdata use this option.
#   - Cluster - removed checks for CPU and MEM
#     - Both checks were senseless for alarming because there are no thresholds.
#       A cluster or resource group is a group of Vmware hosts. Not a logical 
#       construct taking parts of the hosts in a resource group in a manner
#       that several clusters are using the same hosts. So the amount of CPU
#       and memory of all hosts is the CPU and memory of the cluster. Monitoring
#       this makes no sense because there are no thresholds for alerting. For
#       example 50% CPU usage of a cluster can be one host with 90%, and two
#       with 30% each. With an average of 50% everything seems to be ok but one
#       machine has definetely a problem. Same for memory. 
#
# - 21 Aug 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.19
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - Some minor corrections in output.
#   - host_storage_info()
#     - Some corrections in output for LUNs. Using <code> in output was a
#       really stupid idea because the code (like ok,error-lostCommunication or
#       whatever is valid there) was interpreted as non existing HTML code.
#     - Some corrections in output for multipath/paths.
#     - Bugfix. Due to a wrong placed curly bracked the output was doubled. Fixed.
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - Small bugfix. It may happen within the heath check that some values are not set
#       by VMware/hardware. In this case we have an
#       "[Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string ..."
#       To avoid this we check the values of the hash with each loop an in case a value
#       is not set we replace it whit the string "Unknown".
#
# - 24 Aug 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.20
#   - datastore_volumes_info(). Some improvements.
#     - Output. Because it was hard to see an alerting volume within the mass of others
#       the output is now grouped so that all alerting volumes are listed on top with 
#       a leading comment. Second are the volumes with no errors. Theses volumes are
#       seperated by a line and also introduced by a comment.
#     - New commandline switch --spaceleft.  When checking multiple volumes the threshold
#       must be given in either percent (old) OR space left on device.(New)
#
# - 28 Aug 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.20a
#   - datastore_volumes_info().
#     - Fixed some small bugs in output.
#
# - 7 Oct 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.21
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - If the CIM server is not running (or not running correctly) the health
#       check receives a lot of unknown events even in the case the hardware
#       status from the GUI looks ok. So we check for the first CPU. If it is
#       unknown be sure the CIM server has to be restarted. After this you will
#       notice a difference in the GUI too.
#   - host_net_info()
#     - In case of an unplugged/disconnected NIC the state is now warning
#       instead of critical because an unplugged card is not always a critical
#       situtation but the admin should take notice of that.
#
# - 16 Dec 2014 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.22
#   - Around line 1680:
#     - The previous check for an valid session was done with a string compare. This method
#       was taken from the VMware website. But it didn't work correctly. In $@ you will find
#       after an eval the error message in case of an error or nothing when it was successfull.
#       The problem was the string compare. If another language as English was choosen this
#       didn't work. So now it's only checked whether $@ has a content (error) or is empty (success).
#
# - 27 Dec 2015 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.22a
#   - Bugfix:
#     - Instead of mapping 1 to 0 with --ignore_warning 2 was mapped to 0. Corrected.
#
# - 31 May 2015 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.23
#   - check_vmware_esx.pl:
#     - New option --statelabel to have the label OK, CRITICAL etc. in plugin output to
#       fulfill the rules of the plugin developer guidelines. This was proposed by Simon Meggle.
#       See Readme.
#     - Added test for session file directory. Thanks Simon.
#     - Replaced variable $plugin_cache with $sessionfile_dir_def. $plugin_cache was copied from
#       another plugin of me. But this plugin doesn't  store any data. it was only used to store the 
#       session files (and session file lock files) and therefore the name was misleading.
#   - host_storage_info()
#     - Bugfix: Fixed bug in host storage adapter whitelisting.(Simon Meggle)
#     - Bugfix: Elements not matching the whitelist were not counted as ignored.(Simon Meggle)
#   - host_net_info()
#     - Bugfix: Fixed missing semicolon between some perf values and warning threshold.(Simon Meggle)
#   - host_runtime_info()
#     - Bugfix: Elements not matching the whitelist were not counted as ignored.(Simon Meggle)
#     - Raise a message after first host runtime issue. Changed state for that check to warning.(Simon Meggle)
#   - dc_runtime_info.pm
#     - Bugfix: Elements not matching the whitelist were not counted as ignored.(Simon Meggle)
#     - New option --showall. Without this only the tool status of machines with problems is listed.
#     -  Bugfix: "Installed,running,supported and newer than the version available on the host." was set
#        to warning but this is quit ok.
#      - In case of a complete runtime check the output is shorted. 
#   - vm_net_info()
#     - Bugfix: Fixed missing semicolon between some perf values and warning threshold.(Simon Meggle)
#
# - 31 May 2015 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.24
#   - check_vmware_esx.pl:
#     - Option --statelabels changed from a switch to handing over a value (y or n). This was done as mentioned 
#       earlier to fulfill to have the label OK, CRITICAL etc. in plugin output to
#       fulfill the rules of the plugin developer guidelines. This was proposed by Simon Meggle.
#       See Readme.
#     - Bugfix: Wrong output for --statelabels from the help.
#
# - 3 Jun 2015 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.25
#   - check_vmware_esx.pl:and dc_runtime_info()
#     - New optione --open-vm-tools to signalize that Open VM Tools are used and that the 
#       version of the tools on the host is obsolete.
#   - dc_runtime_info()
#     - "VMware Tools is installed, but it is not managed by VMWare" will except the previous point
#       now lead to a warning (1) instead of a critical (2).
#
#- 10 Jun 2015 M.Fuerstenau version 0.9.26
#  - help()
#    - Bugfix: --nosession was printed out twice. Same line the not "not" was missing.
#      This was bad because it changed the meaning of the line. Same error in the command reference
#      because the reference is only the output from the help in a file.
