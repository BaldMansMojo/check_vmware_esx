General options:
================

-?, --usage                          Print usage information
-h, --help                           Print detailed help screen
-V, --version                        Print version information
    --ignore_unknown                 Sometimes 3 (unknown) is returned from a component.
                                     But the check itself is ok.
                                     With this option the plugin will return OK (0) instead of UNKNOWN (3).
    --ignore_warning                 Sometimes 2 (warning) is returned from a component.
                                     But the check itself is ok (from an operator view).
                                     With this option the plugin will return OK (0) instead of WARNING (1).
    --statelabels=<y/n>              Whether or not statelabels as described in the Nagios Plugin Developer
                                     Guidelines (OK, CRITICAL, WARNING etc.) will printed out. Technically
                                     these are not neccessary because the infomation is available via the colour
                                     in the WebGui (red/green/yellow etc.)and for notifications via the macros
                                     $SERVICESTATE$ and $SERVICESTATEID$. The default behaviour can be changed
                                     by setting the variable $statelabels_def in the plugin from y to n.
-t, --timeout=INTEGER                Seconds before plugin times out (default: 90)
    --trace=<level>                  Set verbosity level of vSphere API request/respond trace.

Options for authentication:
===========================

                                     To reduce amounts of login/logout events in the vShpere logfiles or a lot of
                                     open sessions using sessionfiles the login part has been rewritten. Using session
                                     files is now the default. Only one session file per host or vCenter is used as
                                     default.

                                     The sessionfile name is automatically set to the vSphere host or the vCenter
                                     (IP or name - whatever is used in the check).

                                     Multiple sessions are possible using different session file names. To form different
                                     session file names the default name is enhenced by the value you set with
                                     --sessionfile.

                                     NOTICE! All checks using the same session are serialized. So a lot of checks
                                     using only one session can cause timeouts. In this case you should enhence the
                                     number of sessions by using --sessionfile in the command definition and define
                                     the value in the service definition command as an extra argument so it can be used
                                     in the command definition as $ARGn$.
     --sessionfile=<sessionfile>     (Optional).Session file name enhancement.
     --sessionfiledir=<directory>    (Optional).If this option is set a path different from the path stored in
                                     $sessionfile_dir_def, which is defined in the plugin will be used.
     --nosession                     (Optional). Don't use a session file. This is the old behaviour. It should
                                     not be used for production use because it can cause a lot of entries in the log
                                     files an therefore can cause abnormal growing of the log.
                                     IT SHOULD BE USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!
-u, --username=<username>            Username to connect with.
-p, --password=<password>            Password to use with the username.
-f, --authfile=<path>                Authentication file with login and password.
                                     File syntax :
                                     username=<login>
                                     password=<password>

Monitoring the vmware datacenter:
=================================

-D, --datacenter=<DCname>           Datacenter/Vcenter hostname.
    --sslport=<port>                If a SSL port different from 443 is used.

Volumes:
--------

-S, --select=volumes                Shows all datastore volumes info
or with
-s, --subselect=<name>              free space info for volume with name <name>

    --gigabyte                      Output in GB instead of MB
    --usedspace                     Output used space instead of free

    --perf_free_space               Perfdata for free space instead of used space. In versions prior to 0.9.18
                                    performance data was always as freespace even if you selected --usedspace.
                                    Now with --usedspace perf data will be also in used space.
                                    This option is mainly to preserve existing performce data.

    --alertonly                     List only alerting volumes
-B, --exclude=<black_list>          Blacklist volumes.
-W, --include=<white_list>          Whitelist volumes.

                                    Use blacklist OR(!) whitelist. Using both in one statement
                                    is not allowed.

    --isregexp                      Whether to treat name, blacklist and whitelist as regexp
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold.
-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold.
                                    Thresholds should be either a simple counter or a percentage
                                    value in the n% (i.e. 90%). If checking more than a single
                                    with --usedspace volume only percent is allowed as threshold or
                                    --spaceleft must be used.
    --spaceleft                     This has to be used in conjunction with thresholds as mentioned above.
                                    The thresholds must be specified as the space left on device and with the
                                    same unit (MB or GB).

Runtime Info:
-------------

-S, --select=runtime                Shows all runtime info for the datacenter/Vcenter.
                                    No thresholds are allowed here
or with
-s, --subselect=listvms             List of vmware machines and their power state..

                                    BEWARE!! In larger environments systems can cause trouble displaying
                                    the informations needed due to the mass of data.
                                  . Use --alertonly to avoid this.

-B, --exclude=<black_list>          Blacklist VMs.
-W, --include=<white_list>          Whitelist VMs.

                                    Use blacklist OR(!) whitelist. Using both in one statement
                                    is not allowed.

    --isregexp                      Whether to treat blacklist and whitelist as regexp
    --multiline                     Multiline output in overview. This mean technically that
                                    a multiline output uses a HTML <br> for the GUI instead of
                                    Be aware that your messing connections (email, SMS...) must use
                                    a filter to file out the <br>. A sed oneliner like the following
                                    will do the job: sed 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
    --alertonly                     List only alerting VMs. Important here to avoid masses of data.
or
-s, --subselect=listhost            List of VMware ESX hosts and their power state..
                                    Power state can be (from the docs):
                                    - poweredOff  The host was specifically powered off by the user
                                                  through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state,
                                                  because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power
                                                  off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the
                                                  processes but fail to power off.
                                    - poweredOn   The host is powered on
                                    - standBy     The host was specifically put in standby mode, either
                                                  explicitly by the user, or automatically by DPM. This
                                                  state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter
                                                  issues the command to put the host in stand-by state,
                                                  the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail
                                                  to power off.
                                    - unknown     If the host is disconnected, or notResponding, we can not
                                                  possibly have knowledge of its power state. Hence, the
                                                  host is marked as unknown.

    --sslport=<port>                If a SSL port different from 443 is used.

Uptime:
-------

-S, --select=uptime                 Displays uptime of the vmware host.

CPU:
----

-S, --select=cpu                    CPU usage in percentage
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold in percent.
-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold in percent.
or with
-s, --subselect=ready               Percentage of time that the virtual machine was
                                    ready, but could not get scheduled to run on the
                                    physical CPU. CPU ready time is dependent on the
                                    number of virtual machines on the host and their
                                    CPU loads. High or growing ready time can be a
                                    hint CPU bottlenecks
or
-s, --subselect=wait                CPU time spent in wait state. The wait total includes
                                    time spent the CPU idle, CPU swap wait, and CPU I/O
                                    wait states. High or growing wait time can be a
                                    hint I/O bottlenecks.
or
-s, --subselect=usage               Actively used CPU of the host, as a percentage of
                                    the total available CPU. Active CPU is approximately
                                    equal to the ratio of the used CPU to the available
                                    CPU.

                                    Available CPU = # of physical CPUs x clock rate

                                    100% represents all CPUs on the host. For example,
                                    if a four-CPU host is running a virtual machine with
                                    two CPUs, and the usage is 50%, the host is using two
                                    CPUs completely.
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold in percent.

                                    on the host in MB. In case of an error all VMs with their
                                    swap used will be displayed. Use --multiline to have
                                    a better formatted output.
    --multiline                     Multiline output in overview. This mean technically that
                                    a multiline output uses a HTML <br> for the GUI instead of
                                    Be aware that your messing connections (email, SMS...) must use
                                    a filter to file out the <br>. A sed oneliner like the following
                                    will do the job: sed 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
or

                                    If the balloon target value is greater than the balloon
                                    value, the VMkernel inflates the balloon, causing more
                                    virtual machine memory to be reclaimed. If the balloon
                                    target value is less than the balloon value, the VMkernel
                                    deflates the balloon, which allows the virtual machine to

-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold.
                                    Thresholds should be either a simple counter or a percentage
                                    value in the n% (i.e. 90%). If checking more than a single

                                    --spaceleft must be used.
    --spaceleft                     This has to be used in conjunction with thresholds as mentioned above.
                                    The thresholds must be specified as the space left on device and with the

                                    BEWARE!! Without a subselect only a summary will be listed.
                                    Larger environments in SAN systems can cause trouble displaying the
                                    informations needed due to the mass of data even when used with subselects
                                  . Use --alertonly to avoid this.

                                    to VMWare SOAP API.

Monitoring a virtual machine via vmware datacenter or vmware host:
==================================================================

-D, --datacenter=<DCname>           Datacenter hostname.
  or 
-H, --host=<hostname>               ESX or ESXi hostname.

-N, --name=<vmname>                 Virtual machine name.
    --sslport=<port>                If a SSL port different from 443 is used.

CPU:
----

-S, --select=cpu                    CPU usage in percentage
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold in percent.
-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold in percent.
or with
-s, --subselect=ready               Percentage of time that the virtual machine was
                                    ready, but could not get scheduled to run on the
                                    physical CPU. CPU ready time is dependent on the
                                    number of virtual machines on the host and their
                                    CPU loads. High or growing ready time can be a
                                    hint CPU bottlenecks
or
-s, --subselect=wait                CPU time spent in wait state. The wait total includes
                                    time spent the CPU idle, CPU swap wait, and CPU I/O
                                    wait states. High or growing wait time can be a
                                    hint I/O bottlenecks.
or
-s, --subselect=usage               Amount of actively used virtual CPU, as a percentage
                                    of total available CPU. This is the host's view of
                                    the CPU usage, not the guest operating system view.
                                    It is the average CPU utilization over all available
                                    virtual CPUs in the virtual machine. For example, if
                                    a virtual machine with one virtual CPU is running on
                                    a host that has four physical CPUs and the CPU usage
                                    is 100%, the virtual machine is using one physical CPU
                                    completely. 
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold in percent.

                                    machine "physical" memory.
or
-s, --subselect=consumed            Amount of guest physical memory in MB consumed by the
                                    virtual machine for guest memory. Consumed memory does
                                    not include overhead memory. It includes shared memory
                                    and memory that might be reserved, but not actually
                                    used. Use this metric for charge-back purposes.
                                    vm consumed memory = memory granted - memory saved
or
-s, --subselect=memctl              Amount of guest physical memory that is currently
                                    reclaimed from the virtual machine through ballooning.
                                    This is the amount of guest physical memory that has been
                                    allocated and pinned by the balloon driver.

or
-s, --subselect=send                Send in KBps(Kilobytes per Second).

Disk I/O:
---------

-S, --select=io                     Shows all disk io info. Without subselect no thresholds
                                    can be given. All I/O values are aggregated from historical
                                    intervals over the past 24 hours with a 5 minute sample rate.
or with
-s, --subselect=read                Average number of kilobytes read from the disk each second.

                                    no thresholds can be given.
or with
-s, --subselect=con                 Shows the connection state. Connection state can be:
                                    connected	The server has access to the virtual machine.
                                    disconnected	When checked directly by a VMware host, then
                                                  the disconnected state is not possible. However,
                                                  when accessed through VirtualCenter, the state
                                                  of a virtual machine is set to disconnected if
                                                  the hosts that manage the virtual machine becomes
                                                  unavailable.
                                    inaccessible	One or more of the virtual machine configuration
                                                  files are inaccessible. For example, this can be
                                                  due to transient disk failures. In this case, no
                                                  configuration can be returned for a virtual machine.
                                    invalid	The virtual machine configuration format is invalid.
                                                  Thus, it is accessible on disk, but corrupted in a
                                                  way that does not allow the server to read the content
                                                . In this case, no configuration can be returned for
                                                  a virtual machine.
                                    orphaned	The virtual machine is no longer registered on the
                                                  host it is associated with. For example, a virtual
                                                  machine that is unregistered or deleted directly on
                                                  a host managed by VirtualCenter shows up in this state.

or with
 -s, --subselect=issues             All issues for the host
     --multiline                    Multiline output in overview. This mean technically that
                                    a multiline output uses a HTML <br> for the GUI instead of
                                    Be aware that your messing connections (email, SMS...) must use
                                    a filter to file out the <br>. A sed oneliner like the following
                                    will do the job: sed 's/<[^<>]*>//g'

Monitoring a vmware cluster via vmware datacenter or vmware host:
=================================================================

-D, --datacenter=<DCname>           Datacenter hostname.
  or 
-H, --host=<hostname>               ESX or ESXi hostname.

-C, --cluster=<clustername>         ESX or ESXi clustername.
    --sslport=<port>                If a SSL port different from 443 is used.
-S, --select=COMMAND
   Specify command type (cpu,mem,net,io,volumes,runtime, ...)
-s, --subselect=SUBCOMMAND
   Specify subselect

-B, --exclude=<black_list>
   Specify black list

    Cluster specific :

Memory:
-------

        * cluster - shows cluster services info
            + effectivecpu - total available cpu resources of all hosts within cluster
            + effectivemem - total amount of machine memory of all hosts in the cluster
            + failover - vmware HA number of failures that can be tolerated
            + cpufainess - fairness of distributed cpu resource allocation
            + memfainess - fairness of distributed mem resource allocation
            ^ only effectivecpu and effectivemem values for cluster services
        * runtime - shows runtime info
            + listvms - list of vmware machines in cluster and their statuses
            + listhost - list of vmware esx host servers in cluster and their statuses
            + status - overall cluster status (gray/green/red/yellow)
                                    States can be (from the docs):
                                    - gray    The status is unknown.
                                    - green   The entity is OK.
                                    - red     The entity definitely has a problem.
                                    - yellow  The entity might have a problem.
            + issues - all issues for the cluster
                b - blacklist issues
            ^ all cluster runtime info

Volumes:
--------

-S, --select=volumes                Shows all datastore volumes info
or with
-s, --subselect=<name>              free space info for volume with name <name>

    --gigabyte                      Output in GB instead of MB
    --usedspace                     Output used space instead of free

    --perf_free_space               Perfdata for free space instead of used space. In versions prior to 0.9.18
                                    performance data was always as freespace even if you selected --usedspace.
                                    Now with --usedspace perf data will be also in used space.
                                    This option is mainly to preserve existing performce data.

    --alertonly                     List only alerting volumes
-B, --exclude=<black_list>          Blacklist volumes.
-W, --include=<white_list>          Whitelist volumes.

                                    Use blacklist OR(!) whitelist. Using both in one statement
                                    is not allowed.

    --isregexp                      Whether to treat name, blacklist and whitelist as regexp
-w, --warning=<threshold>           Warning threshold.
-c, --critical=<threshold>          Critical threshold.
                                    Thresholds should be either a simple counter or a percentage
                                    value in the n% (i.e. 90%). If checking more than a single
                                    with --usedspace volume only percent is allowed as threshold or
                                    --spaceleft must be used.
    --spaceleft                     This has to be used in conjunction with thresholds as mentioned above.
                                    The thresholds must be specified as the space left on device and with the
                                    same unit (MB or GB).
